1426563549225172996 2021-08-14 15:17:09 +0000 <dronias> @lucidnightly @Jolly_Olive Votto OPS (.961) vs. Harper (.976), which is not significantly worse. Replacing Votto with an average 1B means you get average defense (Votto is a good glover) and average HRs, RBI, and BA. What are those averages for 1Bs? I think median values are more relevant in this case.

1426563254831177729 2021-08-14 15:15:58 +0000 <lucidnightly> @dronias @Jolly_Olive RBIs are entirely circumstantial (if someone always had men on base they would have more RBIs than someone who always had bases empty), so they don't really show how good a player is, so they shouldn't be weighted at all. Homers most certainly matter, but you will always (1/2)

1426562980389523459 2021-08-14 15:14:53 +0000 <rgroves11> @RameyTJR @Buster_ESPN It's true that Votto has a relatively low RBI conversion rate in his career relative to other players of his general caliber. But it is largely a function of his walk rate, not his strikeout rate. And walks both advance forced runners and create PA and RBI chances for teammates.

Not sure why fWAR would be more relevant.

1426563254831177729 2021-08-14 15:15:58 +0000 <lucidnightly> @dronias @Jolly_Olive RBIs are entirely circumstantial (if someone always had men on base they would have more RBIs than someone who always had bases empty), so they don't really show how good a player is, so they shouldn't be weighted at all. Homers most certainly matter, but you will always (1/2)

1426562980389523459 2021-08-14 15:14:53 +0000 <rgroves11> @RameyTJR @Buster_ESPN It's true that Votto has a relatively low RBI conversion rate in his career relative to other players of his general caliber. But it is largely a function of his walk rate, not his strikeout rate. And walks both advance forced runners and create PA and RBI chances for teammates.

I probably watch 2 or 3 games a year (unless my local team is in the playoffs, which hasn't happened since I left Boston for Detroit). But I hear "RBIs" from commentators all the time. I assumed it was the norm.

1426524009076830212 2021-08-14 12:40:01 +0000 <RameyTJR> @Buster_ESPN Votto has struck out an amazing 1500 times; many of those looking. He takes 3rd strikes all the time looking to walk, many times with runners in scoring position. His rbi total is low because of this.  Certainly not one of the games all time best or HOF.

Replacing Votto with an average 1B means you get average defense (Votto is a gold glover) and average HRs, RBI, and BA. What are those averages for 1Bs? I think median values are more relevant in this case.  https://t.co/ovhbiCcATv

1426563254831177729 2021-08-14 15:15:58 +0000 <lucidnightly> @dronias @Jolly_Olive RBIs are entirely circumstantial (if someone always had men on base they would have more RBIs than someone who always had bases empty), so they don't really show how good a player is, so they shouldn't be weighted at all. Homers most certainly matter, but you will always (1/2)

1426562980389523459 2021-08-14 15:14:53 +0000 <rgroves11> @RameyTJR @Buster_ESPN It's true that Votto has a relatively low RBI conversion rate in his career relative to other players of his general caliber. But it is largely a function of his walk rate, not his strikeout rate. And walks both advance forced runners and create PA and RBI chances for teammates.

If Bryce had that situation, I’d bet his RBI numbers would be a lot higher. Harper also missed time when he took a fastball to the face. Bryce..
1426551877144043528 2021-08-14 14:30:46 +0000 <DVRinChicago> @mikacooper @CanadyTamar @GrammarTable RBIs was the standard forever, until 30ish years ago. Sean McDonough (Boston, later national) was the first I heard doing plural RBI, but others followed suit. The SABR style guide (see link) calls for RBIs. (It also calls for Fred "Boot nose" Hofmann.)  https://t.co/5kcsBYoXKe

But Socialist Nehru had no knowledge of governance. Rich he was guilty of misusing FE of £1 million for fun despite RBI governor objections.

1426543075564871682 2021-08-14 13:55:47 +0000 <DallasBBritt> It's been a hot two-week stretch for Cristian Pache who's hitting .371/.436/.743 with 3 HRs, 4 2Bs, and 9 RBIs in August. The plate discipline needs to improve, but it seems, unsurprisingly, that a bad 22-game major-league stint may be too small of a sample size. #Braves

Don't U  think " make in india " now is a reversal of your policy ? Don't you think issung oil/ fuel bonds to delay huge recoveries have damaged nation ?

Capacity Utilization in India fallen to 73.6% in Q2, below 10 yr Avg at 74.9%.  Now commodity prices bottomed out &amp; moving higher, So not much room for RBI to ease monetary policy further. Stagflation !!

Its functions will presumably be discharged/superintended by a board. And the GoI will drive monetary policy. India is veering to a command and control economy as the GoI pins institutions under its thumb.
